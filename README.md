# Git Branch Selector

This is an interactive git branch selector. Run it to see a table of the
branches you've worked on recently, use the arrow keys to select one, and press
enter to switch to it. It's easier if you alias it to something short.

## Install

I haven't packaged this (yet?) so you'll have to use the Go toolchain:

```console

go: downloading github.com/adammck/git-branch-selector v0.0.0-20240914031311-89ed3efb0911
